### Play store listing

HourGlass is a small app to be able to track something between two dates so you know what the value should be. You can use this to track how much you should have saved towards a holiday, or how many miles a rental car should be on when you drop it off if you have a quota

HourGlass now supports widget! See the countdown progress right from your home screen

No ads, no purchases required.
